.SH DESCRIPTION
.B minishell
A Unix Shell, or also a shell, is the term used in computer science
to refer to a command interpreter, which consists of the traditional
user interface of Unix-based operating systems and the like, such as
GNU / Linux.

.SH    Overview
The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.It  is  the program that is running when a user logs into the system (although a user can select a different shell with the chsh(1) command).The shell implements a language that has flow control constructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of features in addition to data storage,along with built in history and line editing capabilities.
It incorporates many features to aid interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts).That is,commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and the file can be executed directly by the shell.
